# Project Description
HttpSessionLogin:-
-->This project uses Java to create a system for logging into a website. It's made up of four main parts: Login, Home, Profile, and Logout.
When you try to log in (using the Login part), it checks if your username and password are correct. If they are, it creates a special session just for you using something called HttpSession. It also stores your login details in this session, so it remembers who you are as you move around the website.
-->Once you're logged in, you can see the Home page. This page is personalized just for you based on your login details.
-->There's also a Profile page that shows information about you. Again, it's only accessible if you're logged in.
-->If you want to log out, you can use the Logout button. When you do this, it ends your session, so you're no longer logged in.
Overall, it's a way to keep your information safe when you're using a website that needs you to log in. And it does this by using HttpSession to manage your login details securely.
