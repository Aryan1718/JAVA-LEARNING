FunProject:-
      In this project, I have used various methods to create a simple calculator that performs addition and multiplication operations. I utilized the getParameter method to fetch values from the end-user via an HTML file. In my first servlet, I accessed these values and performed addition operations. Subsequently, I used the setAttribute method to send the sum value to my second servlet. Additionally, I employed RequestDispatcher to forward the request to the second servlet. In the second servlet, I utilized the getAttribute method to fetch the sum and calculate the product. Finally, I printed these values in an HTML file.
